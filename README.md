# mine_sweeper
A minesweeper game for windows, in memory of the pre-installed minesweeper game on Windows XP system. 

# Playing the game
Left-click on "Start" to start the game. 
Left-click on any unrevealed spaces to reveal the space. If there is a mine on that space, you will lose the game. If not, you will know how many mines are neighbouring that space. 
Right-click on a space to flag it if you think that space has a mine. Right-click again on a flag to unflag it if you need. 
Your objective is to reveal all safe spaces without a mine.
GOOD LUCK!!!
